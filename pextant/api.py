    This class performs the A* path finding algorithm and contains the Cost Functions. Also includes
    capabilities for analysis of a path.

    This class still needs performance testing for maps of larger sizes. I don't believe that
    we will be doing anything extremely computationally intensive though.

    Current cost functions are Time, Distance, and (Metabolic) Energy. It would be useful to be able to
    optimize on other resources like battery power or water sublimated, but those are significantly more
    difficult because they depend on shadowing and was not implemented by Aaron.
